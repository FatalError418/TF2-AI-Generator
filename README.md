# The TF2 AI Generator
Using ChatGPT and some python code, I've created this TF2 AI generator which can currently generate a new TF2 weapon card. It's a bit harder to setup than most, but I can assure you it'll be worth it. Scroll down to the setup section for setup instructions. Currenlty it can only generate new weapon cards, but in the future it'll be able to generate more, so keep an eye out!

# Examples
If you don't believe how good this is, here are some examples of the weapon generation (these aren't cherry-picked, I just used the first 5 weapon cards it generated): <br />

# How to get an OpenAI API Key
To use this tool you'll need an OpenAI API Key (OpenAI owns ChatGPT). Do do that, go [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), and assuming you don't have an account (if you do, just log in), tap 'Sign Up'. Enter your email address, enter a password (must be over 8 characters), verify the email, enter your name and birthday (you can use an alias/fake details if you want), and then enter your phone number which is used to verify you are a human. Once that is done, click on 'Create new secret key'. Enter the key name, for example 'tf-ai-generator'. Next, copy the key and paste it into a new notepad file. Save the file as 'OpenAI-API-Key' or something and place it wherever, for convenience's sake you could put it in the installed folder.
