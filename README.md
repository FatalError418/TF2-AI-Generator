# The TF2 Auto-Generator
Using ChatGPT and some python code, I've created this TF2 auto-generator which can currently generate a new TF2 weapon card. It's a bit harder to setup than most, but I can assure you it'll be worth it. Scroll down to the setup section for setup instructions.

# Examples
If you don't believe how good this is, here are some examples of the weapon generation (these aren't cherry-picked, I just used the first 5 weapon cards it generated): <br />

# How to get an OpenAI API Key
To use this tool you'll need an OpenAI API Key (OpenAI owns ChatGPT). Do do that, go [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), and assuming you don't have an account (if you do, just log in), tap 'Sign Up'. Enter your email address, enter a password (must be over 8 characters), verify the email, enter your name and birthday (you can use an alias/fake details if you want), and then enter your phone number which is used to verify you are a human. Once that is done, click on 'Create new secret key'. Enter the key name, for example 'tf-auto-generator'. Next, copy the key and paste it into a new notepad file. Save the file as 'OpenAI-API-Key' or something and place it wherever, for convenience's sake you could put it in the installed folder.
